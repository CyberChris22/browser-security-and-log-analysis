# Browser Security & Log Analysis

This repository hosts a standalone, multi-part cybersecurity project designed to demonstrate **browser-focused threat detection**, **defensive engineering**, and **logfile analysis** from a SOC analyst perspective. It is independent of any prior coursework or labs and showcases practical skills used in real-world security operations to identify and investigate client-side threats, particularly from web browsers. The project was inspired by direct feedback from a hiring manager to highlight skills that matter for a junior-to-mid-level SOC analyst role.

## Part 1: Chrome Attack Surface

Documents common methods attackers use to abuse Google Chrome, including extensions, process exploitation, and access to credential files. Focus is on understanding threat techniques rather than exploitation. Screenshots and documentation are included to illustrate each scenario.

## Part 2: Chrome Detection & Defense

Demonstrates detection engineering by creating custom rules, alerts, and dashboards (e.g., Wazuh) to catch browser-based threats. Includes examples of alert tuning and visualization for SOC-style monitoring.

## Part 3: Logfile Parsing & Baseline Analysis

Focuses on analyst-level log review skills: establishing normal behavioral baselines, detecting subtle anomalies, and investigating events that automated alerts may miss. Sample logs and analysis are provided for reference.

## Tools & Technologies

- Windows endpoints
- Google Chrome
- Wazuh (SIEM/HIDS)
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon (optional)
